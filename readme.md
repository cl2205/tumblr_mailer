In this project, we will create a node.js script file that will email a list of your most recent Tumblr blog posts to a list of friends in a CSV file.

Here's a high-level overview of tasks we'll be accomplishing:

- Create a JavaScript file that can pull data from your Tumblr Blog
- Read in a CSV file of your friends' emails
- Load the content from some time-period of posts from your Tumblr blog
- Populate an email template with your blog content and mail merge it with your friends data
- Send the email using the Mandrill API
